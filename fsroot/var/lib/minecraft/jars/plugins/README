The "plugins" tab of the web interface can enable/disable bukkit
plugins from this subdirectory. The plugins are enabled by symlinking
from the server plugin dir to the jars files here.

For for example an UltraHardcore mod, the directory structure must
look like this:

Ultrahardcore/
UltraHardcore/configuration
UltraHardcore/v0.3.5/
UltraHardcore/v0.3.5/UltraHardcore.jar
UltraHardcore/v0.4.9/
UltraHardcore/v0.4.9/UltraHardcore.jar

The "v0.4.9" is a version number; several different versions of a
plugin can be available. The actual jar can be named anything ending
in ".jar", but there can only be one file in a version directory. The
"configuration" dir is planned to be an installable configuration of
the plugin, but there isn't any interface to install it yet.
